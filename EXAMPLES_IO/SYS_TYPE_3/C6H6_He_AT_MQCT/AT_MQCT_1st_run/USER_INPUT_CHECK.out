THIS RUN PERFORMED ON 11/11/2022 at   9 a.m. 40 minutes, LOCAL MACHINE TIME
YOUR JOB NAME: C6H6+He
 
REDUCED MASS,A.M.U.: MASS =    3.807
 
THE POTENTIAL RANGE: FROM Rmin =   3.00 TO Rmax = 30.00 BOHR
 
COLLISIONAL ENERGIES, CM-1:
E(   1)=  100.000;
 
MAX IMPACT PARAMETER IS,a.u =     30.000
ORBITAL ANGULAR MOMENTUM STEP_SIZE:=   1
 
 
ALL TRAJECTORIES WILL BE STOPPED AFTER TIME_LIMT=  0.3500E+11
 
TRAPPED TRAJECTIRY WILL STOP AFTER   5 ROUNDS AND   10 OSCILLATIONS
 
PROPAGATOR TYPE: RUNGE-KUTTA 4-TH ORDER
TIME STEP IN RUNGE-KUTTA 4TH ORDER        10.00
 
APPROXIMATED TRAJECTORIES WILL BE SAVED IN AT_APPROX_TRAJS
THE COLLISIONAL SYSTEM: RIGID SYMMETRIC TOP + ATOM
ROTATIONAL CONSTANTS ARE, CM-1: A = B =    0.19; C =    0.09 ;
CHANNELS ENERGIES, CM-1:
#N =           J          K          P          E
    1          0          0          0      0.000
INITIAL STATE IS:J =    0; K =    0; P =	   0
 
THE POTENTIAL R-UNITS ARE BOHRS
THE POTENTIAL ENERGY IS IN CM-1
 
COULPING MATRIX WILL BE COMPUTED USING NUMERICAL  INTEGRATION OF POTENTIAL OVER THE WAVEFUNCTIONS
 
SCATTERING CALCULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED
 
THE SYSTEM SETUP DONE SUCCESFULLY
